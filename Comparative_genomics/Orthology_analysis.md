# Powdery mildew orthology and comparative genomics analysis pipeline

Documentation of analysis and commands used for comparative genomics work as part of Nano Diagnostics PhD. - This file documents effector prediction within the three P. aphanis and three P. leucotricha genome assemblies generated previously, and comparison of orthogroups between the two species.

Genomes assembled and annotated in nano_diagnostics/P_aphanis and nano_diagnostics/P_leucotricha 

All the following commands were executed on the Crop Diversity HPC from the folder /home/theaven/scratch unless stated otherwise.
