# Powdery mildew and host phylogeny pipeline

Documentation of analysis and commands used for comparative genomics work as part of Nano Diagnostics PhD. - This file documents the construction of phylogenies for the powdery mildew clade and their host plants.

Genomes assembled and annotated in nano_diagnostics/P_aphanis, nano_diagnostics/P_leucotricha and nano_diagnostics/B_graminis were used alongside genomes downloaded from NCBI for the following analysis.

All the following commands were executed on the Crop Diversity HPC from the folder /home/theaven/scratch unless stated otherwise.
