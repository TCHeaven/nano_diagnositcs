# nano_diagnositcs
Documentation of analyses and commands used as part of the PhD project investigating next generation diagnostics
Note - all this work was performed in the directory:
/home/groups/harrisonlab/project_files/nano_diagnostics 

Work is documented within the following sub folders: 
Scab

Mildew

Additionally, I experimented with running programs manually in the folder:
Temp

These folders were created using the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p /home/groups/harrisonlab/project_files/nano_diagnostics
```
